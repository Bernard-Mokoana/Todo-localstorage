This project is a To-Do List Web Application built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to:

1. Add tasks to a list by typing in an input field and clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing the Enter key.
2. Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, with visual feedback provided via a class toggle.
3. Delete tasks using a dedicated "Delete" button for each task.
4. Persist tasks between sessions using the browser's localStorage.

The application dynamically updates the DOM to reflect task additions, deletions, and completion status changes, creating an interactive and user-friendly experience.
